## 🧠 Overview

This repository contains Python code demonstrating how to implement a basic programming language conversion tool.  
It highlights concepts like:
- Parsing input code
- Mapping basic constructs between languages
- Outputting translated code

Such an approach is useful for learning how translation logic works, understanding the similarity between languages, and building foundations toward advanced transpilers or converters. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
